            { type: 'mcq', text: "A clastic sedimentary rock composed of rounded gravel-sized particles is called:", options: ["Breccia", "Conglomerate", "Sandstone", "Shale"], answer: 'b' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "Which of the following is a chemical sedimentary rock formed by evaporation?", options: ["Coal", "Limestone (Biochemical)", "Rock Gypsum", "Sandstone"], answer: 'c' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "The metamorphic equivalent of Limestone is:", options: ["Quartzite", "Marble", "Slate", "Gneiss"], answer: 'b' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "Metamorphism that occurs due to high heat from a nearby magma body is called:", options: ["Regional metamorphism", "Contact metamorphism", "Dynamic metamorphism", "Burial metamorphism"], answer: 'b' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "Which of the following rocks represents the highest grade of metamorphism?", options: ["Slate", "Phyllite", "Schist", "Gneiss"], answer: 'd' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "Coal is classified as a(n) ............ sedimentary rock.", options: ["Clastic", "Chemical", "Organic", "Intrusive"], answer: 'c' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "A non-foliated metamorphic rock formed from sandstone is:", options: ["Marble", "Quartzite", "Slate", "Schist"], answer: 'b' },
            { type: 'mcq', text: "The process of turning loose sediments into solid rock through compaction and cementation is called:", options: ["Weathering", "Erosion", "Lithification", "Metamorphism"], answer: 'c' },
            // True/False Questions
            { type: 'tf', text: "Breccia is composed of angular gravel-sized particles.", answer: true },
            { type: 'tf', text: "Shale has very high porosity and permeability.", answer: false, explanation: "Shale has LOW porosity/permeability and acts as a barrier for oil." },
            { type: 'tf', text: "Regional metamorphism is associated with mountain building and high pressure.", answer: true },
            { type: 'tf', text: "Foliation is a texture characteristic of contact metamorphism.", answer: false, explanation: "Foliation comes from Pressure/Regional metamorphism. Contact metamorphism produces Non-foliated rocks." },
            { type: 'tf', text: "Coquina is a type of limestone made entirely of shell fragments.", answer: true },
            { type: 'tf', text: "Slate is a low-grade metamorphic rock formed from Shale.", answer: true }
